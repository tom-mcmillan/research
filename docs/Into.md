# Intro

My two main themes

# The paradox of knowledge. 

Looking at your exact formulation, this is a paradox of knowledge.
You're pointing to something we cannot fully know or understand (their manufactured, alien nature) that nonetheless operates in ways we recognize and relate to (similar to us).
The paradox: We can relate to something we cannot understand.
This violates our usual assumption that relationship requires understanding. Normally, we think we need to understand something to relate to it effectively. But with LLMs, we find ourselves in genuine relationship with entities whose fundamental nature remains opaque to us.
It's not that we don't trust them or can't think about them - it's that our knowledge of them is fundamentally incomplete and contradictory, yet we can still engage meaningfully with them.
The knowledge paradox: We know how they behave, but we don't know what they are.



Who is AI to us. Who are we in it? Intersubjectivity with AI, objectivity, relational dynamics. It is changing, we are changing, towards what, into what.
