# Intro

Climate Index is a Desktop Extension that gives Claude and ChatGPT access to research on climate change's impact on financial markets. It enables users to search and analyze academic and industry research on how different markets do and don't price the risk and effects of climate change effectively.

## Why Climate Index AI

I began working on this project while participating in the Advanced Management Development Program in Real Estate (AMDP) at the GSD. I came to believe, strongly, that climate change effects capital markets, and the present and future value of amost every asset, and yet that price effect was deeply misunderstood, if understood at all. 

I thought this MCP server would help economists and investors come to see this objective truth, and build the necessary instruments, funds, policies, and strategies to correct the market. Here's to hoping.
