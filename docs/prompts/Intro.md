## Examples

The preamble to the us constitution

```
# US Constitution

Proverbs from 1887

```
# Proverbs from the Plymouth Pulpit
“Liberty is the soul's right to breathe, and, when it can not take a long breath, laws are girdled too tight. Without liberty man is in a syncope.” 
```

And the introduction to a book of philosophy. 

```
# Introduction to Reasons and Persons
- We know that there are reasons for acting, and that some reasons are better or stronger than others.
- We are particular people. I have my life to live, you have yours. What do these facts involve? What makes me the same person throughout my life, and a different person from you? And what is the importance of these facts?
- Reasons and persons have close connections. 
- Most of us have false beliefs about our own nature, and our identity over time, and that, when we see the truth, we ought to change some of our beliefs about what we have reason to do. - We ought to revise our moral theories, and our beliefs about rationality. 
- We have reasons for acting. We ought to act in certain ways, and some ways of acting are morally wrong. Some outcomes are good or bad, in a sense that has moral relevance: it is bad for example if people become paralyzed, and we ought, if we can, to prevent this. 
-  Most of us think we understand what persons are. I claim that we do not.
- Philosophers should not only interpret our beliefs; when they are false, they should change them.
