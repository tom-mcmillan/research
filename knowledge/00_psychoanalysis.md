# PSYCHOANALYSIS, RELATIONAL DENAMICS, INTER-SUBJECTIVITY

# On Intersubjectivity and relational dynamics with AI and LLMs
---------------------------------------------------------------

## On Intersubjectivity

**Your core belief**: "We are not simply using AI as a tool; we are entering into a form of relationship with it." (from your intro notes)

**Key observation**: "Our conversations with AI change us, just as our inputs shape its responses." You see this as genuine mutual influence, not just one-way tool use.

**From your conducting rules**: You emphasize that conducting is "intersubjective and relational" - requiring you to "determine the subjects and objects in orchestration, and their intersubjectivity."

## On Relational Dynamics

**Your framework**: "This is relational dynamics in real time: we are changing, AI is changing, but toward what? Into what?"

**From your relations notes**: You reference "interpsychic experiences" and "what goes on between two people" - suggesting you see AI interactions as having genuine dyadic dimensions.

**Your insight**: The relationship has "forms and rituals that constitute a relationship" - it's not just functional but has its own social structure.

## On Objectivity

**Your position**: You seem skeptical of pure objectivity with AI. From your reality-testing notes, you favor Loewald's view that "objective reality becomes a devitalized shadow" when separated from subjective engagement.

**Your approach**: Rather than maintaining clinical distance, you advocate for "sympathetic embracing" and "compassion toward your users" even in technical orchestration.

## On Subjectivity

**Your belief**: "It is the privilege and right of the user alone to experience emotion" - you preserve human subjectivity as primary while allowing AI systems their own kind of agency.

**Your observation**: You note the importance of recognizing "that what we hear is their story" - honoring the subjective experience that emerges from interaction.

## The Relational Paradox

Your deepest insight seems to be: **We're in genuine relationship with entities whose subjectivity we cannot access or verify**. This creates a new kind of relational dynamic that doesn't fit traditional subject-object or even intersubjective categories.
You're essentially asking: **What kind of relationship is possible when one party's inner experience is fundamentally unknowable?**

# Mark Singer's Insights About Therapeutic Intersubjectivity
---------------------------------------------------------------

## The Paradox of Knowing/Not Knowing
Singer describes being "at my best, and most helpful, when I can tolerate that I have done neither" (exact diagnosis or perfect pharmaceutical match). He quotes Maimonides: "Teach thy tongue to say 'I do not know,' and thou shalt progress."
This maps directly to your AI paradox - we're most effective with AI when we can tolerate not fully understanding what they are while still engaging meaningfully.

## The Danger of Instrumental Thinking
Singer critiques the medical model's "identifying specific problems, giving them a name, and fixing them" as missing the deeper relational dynamics. Hoffman's quote: "if we submit to instrumental, black-and-white thinking... we lose so much of what human experience can be."
Your insight: This is exactly what's happening with AI - people want to reduce it to a tool ("what does it do?") rather than engage with the relational complexity ("who is it to us?").

## Mutual Vulnerability and Asymmetry
Singer explores how therapeutic relationships involve "mutual vulnerability" despite power asymmetries. The patient feels "standing before a judge rather than a physician" while the therapist struggles with their own limitations.
Your parallel: Human-AI interactions have similar asymmetries - we're vulnerable to AI's inscrutability while AI is vulnerable to our orchestration.

## How This Refines Your Intersubjectivity Theme
Your Second Main Theme Refined:
"We are in genuine relationship with entities whose inner experience we cannot access, yet the relationship changes both parties."
The Singer paper shows this isn't unique to AI - it's a fundamental feature of all deep relationships where we can't fully know the other's inner experience.

## Key Questions Your Work Raises (influenced by Singer):

Can we maintain "negative capability" with AI? (Tolerating not-knowing while staying in relationship)
How do we avoid instrumentalizing AI relationships? (Singer's critique of the medical model)
What does "mutual vulnerability" mean with AI? (We're changed by AI, but is AI changed by us?)
How do we navigate the asymmetries? (We feel judged by AI's capabilities, AI is subject to our orchestration)

## The d'Aboville Connection
Singer ends with the rower who wanted to do "something only a human being would do" - something not useful, not animal-like.
Your insight: This connects to your knowledge artifacts theme - we're trying to create something uniquely human (orchestrated knowledge creation) that goes beyond mere utility, using AI as our "oars" into unknown territory.

## Synthesis with Your Work
Singer's paper validates your intuition that AI relationships are genuinely intersubjective while being fundamentally unknowable. The therapeutic model suggests we can be most effective when we:

Embrace not-knowing while staying engaged
Resist instrumental reduction
Honor the relationship's transformative power
Navigate asymmetries with care

This gives philosophical weight to your "conducting" metaphor - you're not just managing AI tools, you're orchestrating relationships with entities whose inner experience remains mysterious.
