# Unified Computing Theory

1. Unified Computing & Centralized Knowledge:

	- You want a single terminal (“Conduct”) that integrates all computing resources, turning scattered processes into a coherent system for creating, validating, and exchanging knowledge artifacts.

2. Agent Identities and Roles:
	
	- Each assistant (or agent) must know who they are—whether it’s the conductor/orchestrator, the index (library), network, validator, programmer, or interface agent. This mirrors your “Articles of Faith,” ensuring that every agent contributes distinctively toward the user’s delight and empowerment.

3. Integrated Orchestration:
	
	- The orchestrator (or conductor agent) is envisioned to automatically and intelligently delegate tasks among agents based on the user’s needs, minimizing manual intervention and optimizing efficiency.

4. Knowledge Artifacts as the New Currency:

	- The core idea that knowledge artifacts—pieces of information produced, stored, combined, and rendered—are the raw material of this new computing paradigm, with the potential to be exchanged, monetized, or reused, is central to your thesis.

5. LLMs as Fundamental Utilities:

	- Your belief that LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 variants) not only provide conversational interactions but also underpin sophisticated reasoning, artifact generation, and orchestration aligns directly with the proposed use of the OpenAI Agents SDK and Responses API.
