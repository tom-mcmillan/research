# The writing of Derek Parfit -- Study of its design
--------------------------------------------------------------

From Parfit, Derek. *Reasons and Persons*. 1. issued in paperback (with corr.), Reprinted with further corr, Clarendon Press, 1987.

## Excerpt from Introduction to Reasons and Persons:

> ### Introduction  
> Like my cat, I often simply do what I want to do. I am then not using an ability that only persons have. We know that there are reasons for acting, and that some reasons are better or stronger than others. One of the main subjects of this book is a set of questions about what we have reason to do. I shall discuss several theories. Some of these are moral theories, others are theories about rationality.  

> We are particular people. I have my life to live, you have yours. What do these facts involve? What makes me the same person throughout my life, and a different person from you? And what is the importance of these facts? What is the importance of the unity of each life, and of the distinction between different lives, and different persons? These questions are the other main subject of this book.  

> My two subjects, reasons and persons, have close connections. I believe that most of us have false beliefs about our own nature, and our identity over time, and that, when we see the truth, we ought to change some of our beliefs about what we have reason to do. We ought to revise our moral theories, and our beliefs about rationality. In the first two parts of the book I give other arguments for similar conclusions.  

> I shall not describe, in advance, these arguments and conclusions. The List of Contents provides a summary. The book is long, and sometimes complicated. I have therefore separated my arguments into 154 parts, and given each part a descriptive title. I hope that this makes the arguments easier to follow, and shows what the book contains more clearly than an Index of Subjects could. If I had not rearranged the arguments into these separate parts, such an Index would have been too thick with references to be of much use.  

> Many introductions to books of this kind try to explain the central concepts that are used. Since it would take at least a book to give a helpful explanation, I shall waste no time in doing less than this. My central concepts are few. We have *reasons for acting*. We *ought* to act in certain ways, and some ways of acting are *morally* wrong. Some outcomes are *good* or *bad*, in a sense that has moral relevance: it is bad for example if people become paralyzed, and we ought, if we can, to prevent this. Most of us understand my last three sentences well enough to understand my arguments. I shall also use the concept of what is in someone's *self-interest*, or what would be *best for this person*. I discuss this briefly in Appendix I. My last central concept is that of a *person*. Most of us think we understand what persons are. Part Three claims that we do not.  

> Many introductions also try to explain how, when discussing morality, we can hope to make progress. Since the best explanation would be provided by *making* progress, this is the only explanation I shall try to give.  

> Strawson describes two kinds of philosophy, descriptive, and revisionary. Descriptive philosophy gives reasons for what we instinctively assume, and explains and justifies the unchanging central core in our beliefs about ourselves, and the world we inhabit. I have great respect for descriptive philosophy. But, by temperament, I am a revisionist. Except in my dreary Chapter 1, where I cannot avoid repeating what has been shown to be true, I try to challenge what we assume. Philosophers should not only interpret our beliefs; when they are false, they should *change* them.

## Replections of Parfit's Writing Style

1. **Opens with a disarming, concrete image** ("Like my cat, I often simply do what I want to do")

2. **Immediately establishes the stakes** - moves from the mundane to fundamental questions about reasons and identity

3. **Clear statement of his two main subjects** and their connection

4. **Bold thesis statement** - "most of us have false beliefs about our own nature"

5. **Practical navigation aids** - explains his 154-part structure

6. **Conceptual honesty** - won't waste time with inadequate explanations

7. **Methodological transparency** - declares himself a revisionist philosopher

8. **Ending with purpose** - "when [our beliefs] are false, [philosophers] should change them"

## Applied to my writing

Following Parfit's structure, you might open with something concrete about your experience with AI (like his cat analogy), then move to:

- **Your two main subjects**: The paradoxical nature of LLMs + the question of intersubjectivity
The connection: How our evolving relationship with AI should change how we think about knowledge, work, and computing

- **Your bold thesis**: Most of us have false beliefs about what computing is becoming and what knowledge work will look like

- **Your revisionist stance**: Like Parfit, you're not just interpreting current AI discourse - you're arguing we need to fundamentally revise our assumptions

The tone would be:

- **Conversational but serious**
- **Philosophically grounded but accessible**
- **Honest about complexity without being intimidating**
- **Clear about your intellectual project**

Parfit's approach gives you permission to be both rigorous and personal, to make big claims while staying grounded in concrete experience. It's perfect for your interdisciplinary approach spanning philosophy, technology, and strategy.
