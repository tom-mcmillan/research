----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Intro

1. Assumptions
2. Main ideas
3. Diffulties
4. About me, my perspective

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Philosophy

1. **Ontology -- Relationship between human and computer.** 
- What exactly is the dynamic between a human and a computer befor, during, and after a conversation with chatGPT

2. **Epistimology -- GPT as an engine for Knowledge Production**
- What are the hitorical methods for the production of knowledge? What is each method good at producting. Caste of Knowledge outputs, Caste of production engines. Different citation methods, different uses. What is GPT in all this? What do we WANT it to be?

3. **Grasping for metaphors - El Greco - Historical perspective**
- Where have new languages emerged? Where are we in history? What would it mean to be able to address every computer in english?
- Utility
- Liquid capital
- Language
- Marx
- Economy
- Singularoty

5. **Language, Necessity of Naming**
- We have certain feelings about language -- the kinds english, dialect. And there are certain things which are pre-linguistic -- Noam chompsky. I cannot answer these issues completely, but i think it's important to recognize that with LLMs we are newly reliant on language, a system with rules. Are we to accept those rules, or abandon them. Must we write well, or is "good writing" no longer relevant. 

6. **Truth and Reasoning**
- We want to be right, and we need to be right to make money. We have systems in place to prove to others that we are right. Do LLMs follow these systems. Can we build them? Is it possible?

7. **Who are we in all this**. 
Our human and creative spirit. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Technology

1. **First principles**
- LLMs are non-deterministic
- LLMs are constantly changing
- Prompts we pass effect the outputs we get. 

1. **Non-Determinisim**
The exact nature of LLMs and non deterministic computing. What exactly they are doing, and WHY its important to understand thisMuch effort has been spent with "prompting" which aims to make this process deterministic, which it will never be. 

2. **Method: Socratic computing**
A method for interacting with computers. Questions and answers. 

3. **Method: Orchestrating** 
Conducting other computers. Are we now conductors? 

4. **Method: Prompting**
What are good prompts. Where do they occur in history -- constitution, etc. What is the relationship between a preamble, an introduction, and the primary text. It begets the text, but it is not the text. 

4. **Against Method, the limits of methods**
Paul feyerabend. The limitations of methods. Given these limitations, then what do ew do about it. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Strategy

1. **AI knowledge process**
Elicit, Abstract, Instate, Exchange

2. The Disney problem. 
Describe a movie, then print it, then watch it. 
- Hwo to monetize this?
- Who owns this?
- Would the user like this?
- What needs to be done to produce this reality?
- What must we be good at the work on that projects? 

3. **The demise of software, what is computing**
- Software is a way to interface with computers. Do we need it at all. What software will be left. What wuestions should we ask of software in prder to know if it's work keeping?

4. **The future of work.** 
What will people be doing. What should people be doing. 
Russ's PDF about industry trends

5. **Michael T. Porter strategy**
applied to AI and companies or people wishing to adopt it.

## Pedagogy

1. **How to lean about this.** 
Why learn about it. Why i came to learn about it. My learning journey? Avoiding blabber about "AI for _____"

2. **Bibliography**
Reading list, with subject headers.
