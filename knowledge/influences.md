# Sources and Infludences for my thinking

## Summary

- Feyerabend's methodological anarchism + Russell's epistemology = comfort with non-deterministic knowledge creation
- Hayek's dispersed knowledge + Kripke's naming = addressable, exchangeable knowledge artifacts
- Miller's client-centered theory + psychoanalytic dialogue = user-driven AI orchestration
- Strauss's conducting + Wittgenstein's logic = structured yet interpretive AI coordination

## Epistemological Foundations

**Feyerabend's "Against Method"**
This explains your comfort with non-deterministic systems and Russell's "epistemological anarchism" comment. Feyerabend's rejection of universal scientific method maps directly to your approach with LLMs - embracing their unpredictability rather than trying to force deterministic outcomes.

**Russell's "Human Knowledge"**
The schema you outlined (sensations → percepts → memory → knowledge structures) comes directly from this. Your knowledge artifact system mirrors Russell's understanding of how the mind organizes experience into structured knowledge.

**Kripke's "Naming and Necessity"**
This likely influences your emphasis on unique knowledge IDs and addressable artifacts. The idea that names have rigid designation across possible worlds parallels your vision of knowledge artifacts maintaining identity across different contexts and exchanges.

## Relational/Intersubjective Framework

**Mitchell's "Can Love Last?"**
This psychoanalytic perspective on sustained relationships likely informs your thinking about human-AI intersubjectivity and the ongoing nature of the relationship (not just transactional).

**Singer's "All Things Possible"**
The psychoanalytic dialogue framework probably shapes your understanding of how knowledge emerges through conversation and mutual recognition.

## Economic/Strategic Thinking

**Hayek's "The Use of Knowledge in Society"**
This is crucial! Hayek's insight about dispersed knowledge and how market mechanisms coordinate information likely underlies your entire vision of knowledge artifacts as exchangeable units and the need for protocols to coordinate their exchange.

**Parfit's "Reasons and Persons"**
The philosophical rigor around personal identity and what constitutes reasons for action probably influences your thinking about agent autonomy and orchestration.

## Legal/Procedural Framework

**Miller's "Give Them Back Their Lives"**
This is where your client-centered case theory comes from. The emphasis on the client's narrative shaping all strategic decisions is core to your approach - the user's story drives the entire system design.

Aesthetic/Orchestration Principles

**Strauss's "Reflections and Recollections"**
The conductor metaphor! This likely shapes your understanding of orchestration as both technical coordination and artistic interpretation.

**Wittgenstein's "Tractatus"**
The logical structure and the idea that language delimits the boundaries of thought probably influences your thinking about prompts as ontological primitives.
