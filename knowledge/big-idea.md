# Project Overview: Conduct Terminal

Your project centers around building a computational environment called **Conduct**, integrating all user-owned or rented computing resources into one unified terminal.

---

## Vision

**Conduct Terminal** provides a single, coherent computing environment designed to streamline and unify user interactions with computational resources, minimizing friction and cognitive load. The ultimate goal is to enable users to effortlessly create, manage, and monetize knowledge artifacts.

---

## Core Components

### 1. Unified Computing & Centralized Knowledge
- **Conduct Terminal**: A unified interface orchestrating diverse computational resources.
- **Integrated Workflow**: Systematically manages creating, validating, and exchanging knowledge artifacts.

### 2. Agent Identities and Roles
- **Orchestrator (Conductor)**: Manages timing and delegation of tasks to specialized agents.
- **Index (Library)**: Securely stores and retrieves user knowledge for contextual use.
- **Network**: Manages interactions with external systems, users, and protocols.
- **Validator**: Ensures logical coherence, mathematical accuracy, and rigorous correctness.
- **Programmer**: Translates knowledge into reusable, executable programs.
- **Interface**: Presents knowledge artifacts intuitively through visuals and representations.

> Each agent knows its distinct role, shaped by the “Articles of Faith,” and contributes uniquely to user empowerment and satisfaction.

### 3. Integrated Orchestration
- Automatic, intelligent delegation of tasks to appropriate agents.
- Minimizes user’s manual orchestration while maximizing efficiency.

### 4. Knowledge Artifacts as the New Currency
- **Knowledge Artifacts**: Precise, minimally processed units of knowledge.
- Artifacts serve as new raw material—systematically created, validated, stored, combined, and monetized.
- Artifacts become directly addressable, exchangeable, and economically valuable.

### 5. LLMs as Fundamental Utilities
- Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-4 variants) facilitate:
  - Sophisticated reasoning and validation.
  - Generation of actionable knowledge artifacts.
  - Seamless orchestration and intuitive interfacing.
- LLMs underpin a holistic, unified computing experience.

## User Experience and Interface

### Conduct Terminal Panels
- **Cue Panel**: Conversational interface (ChatGPT-like) for user-orchestrator interactions.
- **Display Panel**: Visually renders knowledge artifacts and their combinations clearly and intuitively.
- **Notes Panel**: Provides real-time backend server logs, offering transparency and actionable insights.

---

## Process Flow

1. **Socratic Exchange (Cue)**:
   - User impressions/questions converted into initial, unstructured knowledge sessions.

2. **Knowledge Artifact Generation**:
   - Precise, structured extraction of insights into discrete, identifiable knowledge artifacts.
   - Each artifact includes unique metadata (timestamps, locations, knowledge_id).

3. **Embedding and Storage**:
   - Artifacts stored in vector databases.
   - Facilitates easy retrieval, referencing, and reusability.

4. **Exchange and Rendering**:
   - Artifacts become currency-like resources—combinable and monetizable.
   - Rendered into products, programs, services, and experiences.

## Conceptual Shifts
- From scattered, manual orchestration → integrated, automatic orchestration.
- From isolated computing outputs (e.g., Excel sheets, dialogues) → actionable, reusable artifacts.
- Redefining computational endpoints from isolated interactions → monetizable, integrated solutions.

---

## Future Considerations
- Developing protocols for artifact addressing (“knowledge_id” system).
- Governance of artifact exchanges: monetization, indexing, openness.
- Collaborative frameworks to share, combine, and render knowledge artifacts among teams.

---

## Articles of Faith (Guiding Principles)
- Emphasis on user primacy, simplicity, intuitive understanding, and ethical rigor.
- Advocating for clear roles, collaborative orchestration, and continuous innovation.
- Viewing computing as an orchestra: diverse instruments (agents) harmoniously led by a skillful conductor.
