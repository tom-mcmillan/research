# Notes and Thoughts on Relations, and Relational Dynamics (mostly from Steven)

- Interpsychic experiences, intersubjectivity, relational theory
- "Diastemia" the greek word describing the "gap" that are part of relationships
- "Diatic dimension" what goes on between two people
- The forms and rituals that constitute a relationship
- "Don't talk about it, recognize it and navigate it, like dancing together"

- People come to you with uncertainty and they want you to give them an answer you can use (without having to convince them there is certainty)

- Decisions are organic, and decay like lettuce

- Building a norm and process, together, so we can take risks, that we both tink is fair, and we both trust
- Hard to break through the distrust of self and others. 

- The most important thing is you develop your own sound.
