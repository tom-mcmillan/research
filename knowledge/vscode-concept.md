## Vision (our evolving case theory):

You want to build an integrated, local-first knowledge creation workflow using VS Code as your primary interface. Through direct dialectical interactions with ChatGPT (or another OpenAI model), you'd like to transform impressions about real-world objects into structured, version-controlled knowledge artifacts. VS Code is your workspace; your local folders are your database; Git is your versioning system.

### User experience: 
You want a single, centralized workspace (VS Code) to keep users focused, productive, and motivated. You see significant value—and even emotional joy—in seeing immediate results appear within the workspace.

### Technical insight: 
You recognize LLMs as an orchestrating layer, capable of connecting and unifying multiple backend services—making complex workflows seamless, avoiding fragmented browser tabs, terminal scripts, or manual integrations like Zapier.

### Immediate practical need: 
Your priority is setting up an interactive ChatGPT sidebar inside VS Code, enabling direct conversations. This conversation sidebar will then directly feed into and interact with backend services you've already built.
