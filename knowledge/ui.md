# UI

The "Conduct Terminal" has three panels. 

## "Cue"

on the left side, which stretches top to bottom of the window, which is a chatgpt-like panel where the user chats with /orchestrate. 

## "Display" 

which is in the top right, which is read only, and renders knowledge artifacts, or a combination of knowledge artifacts. 

## Notes

on the bottom right (below "Display") which is read only and prints out the back-end server logs. For now, it should just print the logs. In the future, we'll parse the logs and return more natural language log summaries, which are informative to the user.
