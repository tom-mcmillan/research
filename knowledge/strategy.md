## THESIS: 

My underlying belief is that I can build a terminal, called conduct, that allows users to directly address all computers they own or pay for from one terminal. The user shouldn't have to copy and paste from a million places. The user wants to be happy. To do that, the user needs to go through a knowledge process. A knowledge process involves validating, programming, storing, interfacing, and networking. Currently, the user orchestrates those activities himself, across dozens of websites, web services, databases, and his own local coputer and its programs. 
    
I think the user can do all this from a single terminal. 
    
I think the new "raw material" that the user creates, and renders is "knowledge artifacts". The pieces of knowledge are created in this terminal. They are stored, and they can be combined and rendered into product, programs, systems, etc that the user can make money and happiness from. I think LLMS are a utility that allows this new process to occur. I think the conduct terminal is the place in which this process occurs. 
    
I'm interested in orchestrating computers for the user. 
    
## FOR EXAMPLE:

    a) I don't think an excel sheet is the endpoint. 
    b) Nor do i think a great conversation with chat GPT is the endpoint. 
    
The endpoint is beingable to use computing powers to: 
    
    1. turn impressions and questions into -> knowlede
    3. turn knowledge into -> directly addressable exchangeable artifacts
    4. combine and render those artifacts into -> solutions and profit

## BELIEFS:

We are making a conceptual leap in computing. We are moving beyond scattered computing experiences toward a unified "terminal" (Conduct) that orchestrates all computing capabilities a user owns or rents. This terminal is not merely a console; it's a holistic system dedicated explicitly to producing, managing, validating, interfacing, and exchanging knowledge artifacts. 

### 1. Unified Computing: 

    - users want all their computational resources unified in one seamless experience.
    - Users orchestrate all computing resources from a single terminal ("Conduct").
    - Goal: Reduce cognitive load and friction. Eliminate manual orchestration across dispersed systems
    
### 2. Centralized Knowledge Artifact Generation: 

    - Knowledge is systematically created, validated, stored, combined, and rendered into actionable artifacts.
    - The "raw material" of computing is knowledge artifactsâ€”pieces of knowledge systematically created, stored,    validated, combined, and rendered.
    - Artifacts are valuable precisely because they're combinable, reusable, and monetizable.

### 3. Integrated Orchestration: 

    - The system orchestrates computers, networks, memory, programs, interfaces strategically, not just API calls.
    - LLMs as Fundamental Utilities: LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) underpin the orchestration and creation of knowledge artifacts.
    - Monetizable and Actionable Endpoints: Artifacts produced are explicitly designed to be economically valuable and exchangeable.

### 4. LLMs as Utility Infrastructure:

    - LLMs (like GPT models) are foundational utilities facilitating the complex orchestration process.
    - LLMs enable sophisticated reasoning, validation, instruction translation, artifact generation, and intuitive interfacing.    

### 5. Computational Endpoint Redefined:

    - Reject simple outputs (Excel sheets, individual chat dialogues, isolated outputs).
    - Emphasize an endpoint of actionable, exchangeable, monetizable artifacts (products, programs, services, systems).

## IMPLICATIONS:

Knowledge artifacts become a new currency. This currency can be rendered -- with our terminal, or elsewhere -- into programs, knowledge, experiences, products, programs, books, games, etc. We will want to share our knowledge with others, and draw upon their knowledge when we render new things in our terminal. When teams meet to discuss progress, they will no longer print their outputs and share them, teams will instead share the knowledge they created, and decided as a team how to render that knowledge. Or are they missibng knowledge? What knowledge do they need to generate in order to render the products and programs they wish? This level of exchange will require a protocol. Each knowledge artifact will have a unique address, such as "knowledge_id" : "know_E1OfceRBFz2WsbR0RsWo4xNq". What protocol will we use to address them? What rules will goven this place? Will there be an exchange service? What monetary value will they be assigned? Shal they be indexed? Shall they be free? These are the questions of the future.
