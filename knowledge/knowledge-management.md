# Knowledge Management

We provide a seamless, low-friction experience for the user, which aligns strongly with your project's philosophy.

## Features

### 1. Implicit Knowledge Management:
    
    - All creation, updating, management, and retrieval of Knowledge Artifacts happen automatically by the agents, without explicit user involvement.

### 2. User-Directed Adjustments through Interaction:
    
    - Users shape their knowledge management system indirectly, through normal use. For example, if the user expresses ideas about how knowledge artifacts should behave or be managed, these thoughts automatically become knowledge artifacts themselves, influencing future behavior.

### 3. Continuous Learning Loop:
    
    - Because the user's thoughts about managing knowledge automatically become artifacts, the system iteratively refines itself according to the user's evolving preferences.

## Components

Our design philosophy emphasizes flexibility and leverages advanced AI to handle complexity, thus reducing the burden on users while maintaining powerful customization capabilities. In summary:

### 1. Artifact Agent:
    - Uses the artifact_prompt with a session as input.
    - Produces Knowledge Artifacts in JSON format.
    - Each Knowledge Artifact includes:
        - A unique knowledge_id (address).
        - A timestamp.
        - Variable size and schema, based on the session content.
    - Accessible via the /artifact endpoint.

### 2. Storage (OpenAI Vector DB):
    - Each user has a dedicated vector database hosted by OpenAI.
    - Knowledge Artifacts are embedded and stored there immediately after creation.

### 3. Rememberance Agent:
    - Queries the user's personal vector database.
    - Uses advanced AI-driven strategies to retrieve relevant memories.
    - Can dynamically generate tags or other metadata if useful.
    - Prompt-driven, iterative refinement to improve retrieval over time.

### 4. User Flexibility (Conduct Terminal):
    - If desired, the user can leverage the Conduct Terminal to create structured databases or applications using the unstructured Knowledge Artifacts stored in the vector DB.
