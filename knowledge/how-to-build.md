# How to Build

- just get an empty/dummy app built and installed.
- then add algorithms to it.
- then add the user interaction parts.
- always write tests and documentation along the way.
- build, deploy/install, test, write code, write tests, write docs, fix code...

thatâ€™s the order. over and over and over.
