# Themes of writing what to write about
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Intro

1. Assumptions
2. Main ideas
3. Diffulties
4. About me, my perspective

## Philosophy

1. **Ontology -- Relationship between human and computer.** 
- What exactly is the dynamic between a human and a computer befor, during, and after a conversation with chatGPT

2. **Epistimology -- GPT as an engine for Knowledge Production**
- What are the hitorical methods for the production of knowledge? What is each method good at producting. Caste of Knowledge outputs, Caste of production engines. Different citation methods, different uses. What is GPT in all this? What do we WANT it to be?

3. **Grasping for metaphors - El Greco - Historical perspective**
- Where have new languages emerged? Where are we in history? What would it mean to be able to address every computer in english?
- Utility
- Liquid capital
- Language
- Marx
- Economy
- Singularoty

5. **Language, Necessity of Naming**
- We have certain feelings about language -- the kinds english, dialect. And there are certain things which are pre-linguistic -- Noam chompsky. I cannot answer these issues completely, but i think it's important to recognize that with LLMs we are newly reliant on language, a system with rules. Are we to accept those rules, or abandon them. Must we write well, or is "good writing" no longer relevant. 

6. **Truth and Reasoning**
- We want to be right, and we need to be right to make money. We have systems in place to prove to others that we are right. Do LLMs follow these systems. Can we build them? Is it possible?

7. **Who are we in all this**. 
Our human and creative spirit. 

## Technology

1. **First principles**
- LLMs are non-deterministic
- LLMs are constantly changing
- Prompts we pass effect the outputs we get. 

1. **Non-Determinisim**
The exact nature of LLMs and non deterministic computing. What exactly they are doing, and WHY its important to understand thisMuch effort has been spent with "prompting" which aims to make this process deterministic, which it will never be. 

2. **Method: Socratic computing**
A method for interacting with computers. Questions and answers. 

3. **Method: Orchestrating** 
Conducting other computers. Are we now conductors? 

4. **Method: Prompting**
What are good prompts. Where do they occur in history -- constitution, etc. What is the relationship between a preamble, an introduction, and the primary text. It begets the text, but it is not the text. 

4. **Against Method, the limits of methods**
Paul feyerabend. The limitations of methods. Given these limitations, then what do ew do about it. 

## Strategy

1. **AI knowledge process**
Elicit, Abstract, Instate, Exchange

2. The Disney problem. 
Describe a movie, then print it, then watch it. 
- Hwo to monetize this?
- Who owns this?
- Would the user like this?
- What needs to be done to produce this reality?
- What must we be good at the work on that projects? 

3. **The demise of software, what is computing**
- Software is a way to interface with computers. Do we need it at all. What software will be left. What wuestions should we ask of software in prder to know if it's work keeping?

4. **The future of work.** 
What will people be doing. What should people be doing. 
Russ's PDF about industry trends

5. **Michael T. Porter strategy**
applied to AI and companies or people wishing to adopt it.

# Major themes across notes
---------------------------------------------------------------
**Overview**
- Knowledge as currency / artifact 
- orchestration vs automation
- individual–collective paradox 
- “Knowledge isn’t just information … each artifact gets a unique ID and becomes tradeable.”   

**Intersubjectivity & relational AI**
- AI ↔ human dialogue as a *genuine relationship* that changes both parties
- “We are not simply using AI as a tool; we are entering into a form of relationship with it.”

**The ‘familiar alien‑ness’ paradox**
- LLMs feel conversationally human yet remain fundamentally alien in origin
- “We relate to them as if they’re like us, but we know they’re fundamentally not.”

**Control vs. relationship tension**
- You need useful, orchestratable systems *and* autonomous partners; a conductor metaphor helps inhabit (not resolve) the tension
- “True relationship requires relinquishing control, but useful systems require maintaining control.”


# Sources and Infludences for my thinking

## Summary

- Feyerabend's methodological anarchism + Russell's epistemology = comfort with non-deterministic knowledge creation
- Hayek's dispersed knowledge + Kripke's naming = addressable, exchangeable knowledge artifacts
- Miller's client-centered theory + psychoanalytic dialogue = user-driven AI orchestration
- Strauss's conducting + Wittgenstein's logic = structured yet interpretive AI coordination

## Epistemological Foundations

**Feyerabend's "Against Method"**
This explains your comfort with non-deterministic systems and Russell's "epistemological anarchism" comment. Feyerabend's rejection of universal scientific method maps directly to your approach with LLMs - embracing their unpredictability rather than trying to force deterministic outcomes.

**Russell's "Human Knowledge"**
The schema you outlined (sensations → percepts → memory → knowledge structures) comes directly from this. Your knowledge artifact system mirrors Russell's understanding of how the mind organizes experience into structured knowledge.

**Kripke's "Naming and Necessity"**
This likely influences your emphasis on unique knowledge IDs and addressable artifacts. The idea that names have rigid designation across possible worlds parallels your vision of knowledge artifacts maintaining identity across different contexts and exchanges.

## Relational/Intersubjective Framework

**Mitchell's "Can Love Last?"**
This psychoanalytic perspective on sustained relationships likely informs your thinking about human-AI intersubjectivity and the ongoing nature of the relationship (not just transactional).

**Singer's "All Things Possible"**
The psychoanalytic dialogue framework probably shapes your understanding of how knowledge emerges through conversation and mutual recognition.

## Economic/Strategic Thinking

**Hayek's "The Use of Knowledge in Society"**
This is crucial! Hayek's insight about dispersed knowledge and how market mechanisms coordinate information likely underlies your entire vision of knowledge artifacts as exchangeable units and the need for protocols to coordinate their exchange.

**Parfit's "Reasons and Persons"**
The philosophical rigor around personal identity and what constitutes reasons for action probably influences your thinking about agent autonomy and orchestration.

## Legal/Procedural Framework

**Miller's "Give Them Back Their Lives"**
This is where your client-centered case theory comes from. The emphasis on the client's narrative shaping all strategic decisions is core to your approach - the user's story drives the entire system design.

Aesthetic/Orchestration Principles

**Strauss's "Reflections and Recollections"**
The conductor metaphor! This likely shapes your understanding of orchestration as both technical coordination and artistic interpretation.

**Wittgenstein's "Tractatus"**
The logical structure and the idea that language delimits the boundaries of thought probably influences your thinking about prompts as ontological primitives.
