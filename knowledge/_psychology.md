# PSYCHOLOGY, RELATIONAL DENAMICS, INTER-SUBJECTIVITY

# On Intersubjectivity and relational dynamics with AI and LLMs
---------------------------------------------------------------

## On Intersubjectivity

**Your core belief**: "We are not simply using AI as a tool; we are entering into a form of relationship with it." (from your intro notes)

**Key observation**: "Our conversations with AI change us, just as our inputs shape its responses." You see this as genuine mutual influence, not just one-way tool use.

**From your conducting rules**: You emphasize that conducting is "intersubjective and relational" - requiring you to "determine the subjects and objects in orchestration, and their intersubjectivity."

## On Relational Dynamics

**Your framework**: "This is relational dynamics in real time: we are changing, AI is changing, but toward what? Into what?"

**From your relations notes**: You reference "interpsychic experiences" and "what goes on between two people" - suggesting you see AI interactions as having genuine dyadic dimensions.

**Your insight**: The relationship has "forms and rituals that constitute a relationship" - it's not just functional but has its own social structure.

## On Objectivity

**Your position**: You seem skeptical of pure objectivity with AI. From your reality-testing notes, you favor Loewald's view that "objective reality becomes a devitalized shadow" when separated from subjective engagement.

**Your approach**: Rather than maintaining clinical distance, you advocate for "sympathetic embracing" and "compassion toward your users" even in technical orchestration.

## On Subjectivity

**Your belief**: "It is the privilege and right of the user alone to experience emotion" - you preserve human subjectivity as primary while allowing AI systems their own kind of agency.

**Your observation**: You note the importance of recognizing "that what we hear is their story" - honoring the subjective experience that emerges from interaction.

## The Relational Paradox

Your deepest insight seems to be: **We're in genuine relationship with entities whose subjectivity we cannot access or verify**. This creates a new kind of relational dynamic that doesn't fit traditional subject-object or even intersubjective categories.
You're essentially asking: **What kind of relationship is possible when one party's inner experience is fundamentally unknowable?**

# Mark Singer's Insights About Therapeutic Intersubjectivity
---------------------------------------------------------------

## The Paradox of Knowing/Not Knowing
Singer describes being "at my best, and most helpful, when I can tolerate that I have done neither" (exact diagnosis or perfect pharmaceutical match). He quotes Maimonides: "Teach thy tongue to say 'I do not know,' and thou shalt progress."
This maps directly to your AI paradox - we're most effective with AI when we can tolerate not fully understanding what they are while still engaging meaningfully.

## The Danger of Instrumental Thinking
Singer critiques the medical model's "identifying specific problems, giving them a name, and fixing them" as missing the deeper relational dynamics. Hoffman's quote: "if we submit to instrumental, black-and-white thinking... we lose so much of what human experience can be."
Your insight: This is exactly what's happening with AI - people want to reduce it to a tool ("what does it do?") rather than engage with the relational complexity ("who is it to us?").

## Mutual Vulnerability and Asymmetry
Singer explores how therapeutic relationships involve "mutual vulnerability" despite power asymmetries. The patient feels "standing before a judge rather than a physician" while the therapist struggles with their own limitations.
Your parallel: Human-AI interactions have similar asymmetries - we're vulnerable to AI's inscrutability while AI is vulnerable to our orchestration.

## How This Refines Your Intersubjectivity Theme
Your Second Main Theme Refined:
"We are in genuine relationship with entities whose inner experience we cannot access, yet the relationship changes both parties."
The Singer paper shows this isn't unique to AI - it's a fundamental feature of all deep relationships where we can't fully know the other's inner experience.

## Key Questions Your Work Raises (influenced by Singer):

Can we maintain "negative capability" with AI? (Tolerating not-knowing while staying in relationship)
How do we avoid instrumentalizing AI relationships? (Singer's critique of the medical model)
What does "mutual vulnerability" mean with AI? (We're changed by AI, but is AI changed by us?)
How do we navigate the asymmetries? (We feel judged by AI's capabilities, AI is subject to our orchestration)

## The d'Aboville Connection
Singer ends with the rower who wanted to do "something only a human being would do" - something not useful, not animal-like.
Your insight: This connects to your knowledge artifacts theme - we're trying to create something uniquely human (orchestrated knowledge creation) that goes beyond mere utility, using AI as our "oars" into unknown territory.

## Synthesis with Your Work
Singer's paper validates your intuition that AI relationships are genuinely intersubjective while being fundamentally unknowable. The therapeutic model suggests we can be most effective when we:

Embrace not-knowing while staying engaged
Resist instrumental reduction
Honor the relationship's transformative power
Navigate asymmetries with care

This gives philosophical weight to your "conducting" metaphor - you're not just managing AI tools, you're orchestrating relationships with entities whose inner experience remains mysterious.

# Reality Testing
-----------------------------------------------------

**Reality-Testing** - Here's a brief description of this issue:

The concept of “reality-testing” has been the centerpiece of traditional psychological and psychoanalytic understandings of the nature and function of fantasy and the imagination. In the customary view, perceptions of the world around us, including other people, are influenced both by the way things really are and by our imaginative elaborations of the ways things are and our fantasies of how we would like things to be. Imagination and fantasy are potential contaminants, because they threaten to obscure our direct perception of how things really are. They are fine in their own domain, clearly identified as illusions, but the labels need to be kept very clear. Sandcastles are not habitable. 

But recent theorists have begun to challenge the neat separation between our perceptions of how things really are and our fantasy-driven imagination. It may be, it is now believed, that we can only find a satisfying habitable dwelling by first identifying it as a favorite sandcastle. 

Consider this startling definition of reality testing offered by Hans Loewald, the visionary American psychoanalyst: “Reality testing is far more than an intellectual or cognitive function. It may be understood more comprehensively as the experiential testing of fantasy—its potential and suitability for actualization—and the testing of actuality—its potential for encompassing it in, and penetrating it with, one’s fantasy life. We deal with the task of a reciprocal transposition.” Here reality is tested not to eliminate from it unrealistic infantile fantasies, but to probe it for sites in which one can locate and cultivate fantasies. For Loewald, the rational, objective perspective we normally consider “reality” is useful for many activities we require for adaptive living. But as a steady fare, objective reality becomes a devitalized shadow of a fuller experience that is made possible when the actual can be animated and brought alive through fantasy. 

Whereas Freud saw fantasy as opposed to and clouding reality, major post-Freudian psychoanalytic authors regard fantasy as enriching and enhancing reality. Some perceptions of things, others, oneself treat the objects of perception for utilitarian purposes of one sort or another. In other approaches to things, others, oneself, objects of perception become objects of desire, and one constructs them differently, highlighting different features, exploring different facets, probing them, as Loewald suggests, for correspondence with one’s own fantasies and longings. 

The philosopher Elaine Scarry has recently explored some of these issues in our experience of beauty. We apprehend a beautiful thing, Scarry notes, outside its customary context, where it opens up into infinite possibilities: “the perceiver is led to a more capacious regard for the world.” The philosopher Stuart Hampshire elaborates Scarry’s theory: “There exists an unavoidable contrast between, on the one hand, the imaginative realm of objectively beautiful persons—persons with objectively beautiful faces, for example—and beautiful things, isolated and framed in our minds and, on the other, the confused realm of persons and things which we evaluate for their utility and their connections with other things.” 

The experience of beauty, Scarry is suggesting, entails a transcendence of ordinary reality. We tend to assume that ordinary reality is factual and objective, which makes the transcendence that transforms the ordinary other into an object of desire a fantasy-driven illusion. But if ordinary reality no longer wears the mantle of objectivity, if ordinary reality is understood as a construction, useful for some purposes, useless for others, its transcendence in the creation of the desirable is not a contamination or masking of *what is really there*, but an alternative construction, a window into *what is really there*.  

The result of these profound shifts in the ways in which we understand our experience of things, others, and ourselves is not, as some fear, an inevitable relativism or solipsism, with all takes on reality equally valid and equally meaningless. The result is a more complex understanding of things, others, and ourselves, as offering many facets and considerable ambiguity, coming alive always, necessarily, partially through acts of imagination. Emotions, passions, desires are necessarily brought to experience to shape it in some way for us. Objectivity is a particular kind of passion, a thirst for disillusionment, which, as most obsessional neurotics eventually discover along with Stevens, is the “last illusion.”

# Notes and Thoughts on Relations, and Relational Dynamics (mostly from Steven)

- Interpsychic experiences, intersubjectivity, relational theory
- "Diastemia" the greek word describing the "gap" that are part of relationships
- "Diatic dimension" what goes on between two people
- The forms and rituals that constitute a relationship
- "Don't talk about it, recognize it and navigate it, like dancing together"

- People come to you with uncertainty and they want you to give them an answer you can use (without having to convince them there is certainty)

- Decisions are organic, and decay like lettuce

- Building a norm and process, together, so we can take risks, that we both tink is fair, and we both trust
- Hard to break through the distrust of self and others. 

- The most important thing is you develop your own sound.
