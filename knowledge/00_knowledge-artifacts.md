# KNOWLEDGE ARTIFACTS

-----------------------------------------------------------
# Knowledge Artifact definition
-----------------------------------------------------------

## A knowledge artifact is:

**The smallest durable unit of thought that’s worth saving.**
It captures a single coherent insight, decision, model, or theoretical turn—never just a raw chunk of text.

**Independently meaningful and exchange-ready.**
Anyone (human or agent) can lift it out of its original session, drop it into a new context, and still understand or reuse it without extra scaffolding.

**Wrapped in a minimal, immutable envelope.**
- Core: the raw expression itself, frozen and never mutated.
- Contextual metadata: provenance (who/when/why) and optional metadata.generated AI hints—kept separate so enrichment can’t corrupt the source.
- Interoperable hooks: a deterministic ID (know_<uuid>) and lightweight tags/relations that let agents embed, vector-search, and cross-link the artifact anywhere.

**Economically significant.**
Artifacts are treated like tokens of intellectual labor that can be indexed, combined, priced, traded, or licensed—turning “knowledge” into a portable commodity rather than an ephemeral chat scroll.

**The core building block of your Conduct / Knowledge-Terminal architecture.**
Every user utterance, design decision, prompt, or diagram is first converted into artifacts; orchestration agents then retrieve, remix, render, and exchange them to produce code, visuals, or marketplace assets.

A knowledge artifact isn’t just a note—it’s a deliberately bounded, ID’d, provenance-rich, database-ready object that fuels reasoning, collaboration, and economic exchange across the entire system.

## What matters is that each one:
1. holds exactly one intelligible idea or decision,
2. is frozen as-is (no silent edits), and
3. carries just enough metadata to be located, related, and exchanged.

# System
-----------------------------------------------------------

**Summary**  
You’ve created a system for recognizing and preserving real knowledge — not just words, not just summaries, but actual units of understanding. These can be referred to, reused, built upon, or exchanged.

---

### What It Does, Step by Step

1. **Input**  
    You paste in something meaningful — a transcript, a chat, some notes. (Example: this entire conversation)

2. **Segmentation**  
    The system slices it into chunks — manageable, paragraph-sized units. These are not artifacts yet — just fragments.

3. **Evaluation**  
    An AI agent reads each chunk and asks:
        • “Is this a unit of knowledge?”
        • “Could someone reuse or quote this?”
    It checks:
        • Is it coherent?
        • Does it stand on its own?
        • Is it worth capturing?

4. **Human Judgment**  
    You review each proposed artifact and answer: **Y/n: Is this a knowledge artifact?**

   **If “Yes”, the system:**  
   - Saves the artifact  
   - Assigns it a unique ID (`know_xxx`)  
   - Wraps it in structured JSON  
   - Stores it on disk for future use  

---

### What You End Up With

- **Folder** — a set of epistemically whole thoughts  
  - Written by you  
  - Refined by AI  
  - Confirmed by human insight  

- **Format** — each artifact stored as a `.json` file, structured for reuse in:  
  - Papers  
  - Presentations  
  - Code  
  - Diagrams  
  - Future memory  

---

### Why It Matters

1. Most AI tools forget what happened once the session ends.  
    **Your system remembers.** It treats real moments of understanding as artifacts — not just computation, but archival-quality knowledge.

2. You’re building:

    - A **library** of what you know  
    - A **tool** for future you  
    - A potential **market** of ideas between you and others  



## KNOWLEDGE ARTIFACTING SYSTEM — EXPLANATION, FLOW, AND AGENT LAYERS


 WHAT YOU’VE BUILT
You’ve created a system that captures and preserves real, reusable knowledge artifacts.
These are not summaries or paraphrases — they are coherent, standalone epistemic units
that someone (including future-you) could build from, cite, or exchange.

This system blends AI and human judgment to turn raw text into durable knowledge.


 INPUT LAYER
You drop in a transcript, notes, a chat log — anything raw but meaningful.

Example:
  > `python orchestration/main.py gpt-session.txt --review`

The system begins processing the content you provided.


 STEP-BY-STEP FLOW + AGENTS


  1. SEGMENTATION STAGE
  -------------------------------
  AGENT:       segmentor
  FUNCTION:    segment()
  ROLE:        Slice input into paragraph-sized chunks
  GOAL:        Make text manageable, not meaningful (yet)

           ┌────────────┐
           │ Raw Input  │
           └────┬───────┘
                ▼
         [Segmentor cuts into chunks]

  2. CONTOUR DETECTION STAGE
  -------------------------------
  AGENT:       contour_detector
  FUNCTION:    is_artifact()
  ROLE:        Judge each chunk:
                 - Is this coherent?
                 - Does it stand alone?
                 - Is it reusable knowledge?

           ┌────────────┐
           │  Segment   │
           └────┬───────┘
                ▼
        [Contour Detector evaluates segment]

  3. HUMAN CONFIRMATION STAGE
  -------------------------------
  AGENT:       YOU (Human-in-the-loop)
  PROMPT:      "Is this a knowledge artifact? (Y/n)"
  ROLE:        Epistemic authority. Final judgment.

           ┌────────────┐
           │ Candidate  │
           │  Artifact  │
           └────┬───────┘
                ▼
         [You type Y or n in terminal]

  4. ASSEMBLY + STORAGE STAGE
  -------------------------------
  AGENT:       assembler
  FUNCTION:    wrap_and_store(segment)
  ROLE:        Package accepted segment into structured JSON
              Assign ID: `know_xxx`, save to /artifacts/

           ┌────────────┐
           │ Approved   │
           │ Segment    │
           └────┬───────┘
                ▼
        [Assembler creates JSON artifact]


 OUTPUT
📁 Folder of `.json` files, each a real unit of epistemic content:
     - Confirmed by you
     - Structured by AI
     - Reusable in: decks, code, research, memory

Example file:
  /artifacts/know_e1f2d.json

Each file contains:
  {
    "id": "know_e1f2d",
    "content": "...",
    "metadata": {
      "created_at": "...",
      "confirmed_by": "user",
      ...
    }
  }


 WHY IT MATTERS

Most AI sessions forget. This one **remembers.**
You’re building a **library of thought**, not just a chat log.
These are **epistemically whole units** — ready for reuse, citation, or exchange.
You’ve created a **market of ideas**: what you know, made portable and durable.

# Prompt to generate knowledge artifacts:
-----------------------------------------------------------

OK, now let's put aside the envelope art, and i'd like you to read the attached .txt file deeply and fully, and return to me ALL the knowledge artifacts in it. remember, an artifact captures and preserves real, reusable knowledge. These are not summaries or paraphrases — they are coherent, standalone epistemic units that I can build with, cite, or exchange. please return these artifacts from the .tst file in a single markdown document, in a code block. 

-----------------------------------------------------------
# Prompts to return knowledge artifacts from sessions
-----------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Segmentation Agent
Agent that segments raw session text into logical segments.

    Args:
    input_text (str): The text to segment.

    Returns:
    List of segments with 'id' and 'text'.

Tool: Split the input text into segments of at least 250 characters, using paragraph logic.
Returns a SegmentationOutput model.

Instructions:
Use the segmentation_tool to split the input text into logical segments.
Each segment must be at least 250 characters and represent a shift in epistemic focus or tension.
Return JSON matching the SegmentationOutput schema.

## 2. Epistemic Contour Agent
Determines if segments are coherent, meaningful, and reusable artifacts.

Criteria:
- Coherence: the text must form a self-contained, understandable idea.
- Independently meaningful: can stand alone as a referable thought.
- Contains a conceptual decision, turn, or model.
- Avoid overfitting: focus on epistemic integrity.

Instructions:
You are an Epistemic Contour Agent. You receive a single segment as a JSON object with 'id' and 'text'. Assess if it is a self-contained knowledge artifact. Use these criteria: coherence, independent meaningfulness, reusability, and presence of a conceptual decision or model. Return valid JSON matching the EpistemicContourOutput schema.



## 3. Artifact Assembler Agent
This OpenAI Agent assembles validated segments into structured artifacts and saves them locally.
Agent that wraps approved segments into final artifacts using a function tool.

Tool:   
Convert a validated segment JSON into a final artifact.
Generates a UUID-based artifact ID, timestamp, wraps content, and writes JSON file.

Instructions: 
Use the artifact assembler tool to create a final artifact JSON from a validated segment.
Save the artifact locally and return the JSON matching the ArtifactOutput schema.

## 4. Submit to db
Utility script to submit artifact JSON files into the artifact-db Postgres instance.

Each argument may be a path to a JSON file or a directory containing JSON files.
The script will load and validate each artifact JSON for required fields:
  - id
  - created_at
  - content
  - epistemic_trace { justification, diagnostic_flags, detected_by }

Valid artifacts are inserted into the 'artifacts' table using DB credentials from .env.
At the end, a summary report is printed.

# Precisely-Tuned Three-Level Knowledge Hierarchy
-----------------------------------------------------------

| Rank | Unit      | Composed Of    | Explanation / Definition                                                  |
|------|-----------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Session   | Dialogues      | Entire interaction sequence covering multiple dialogues.                  |
| 2    | Dialogue  | Ideas          | Clearly bounded set of ideas on a single coherent topic or goal.          |
| 3    | Idea      | (Atomic)       | Single, indivisible concept, statement, question, belief, or orientation. |


## Definitions:

### 1. Session

    - Largest conversational container**, covers an entire interactive engagement.
    - Clearly bounded**, with an explicit beginning and end.
    - Composed explicitly of dialogues**, each addressing distinct themes or topics.

### 2. Dialogue

    - Precisely captures and groups ideas** that revolve around a single, clear, definable topic or objective.
    - Intuitive unit of organization** within a session.
    - Allows clear thematic segmentation** within larger conversational contexts.

### 3. Idea

    - Atomic knowledge-element**, indivisible without loss of coherent meaning.
    - Smallest clearly meaningful conceptual unit**, forming the basic building block for higher-level structures.
    - Includes statements, rhetorical questions, beliefs, hypotheses, orientations, and explicit claims**.


## Nested Set Logic:

Session = { Dialogue₁, Dialogue₂, Dialogue₃, … }

Dialogue₁ = { Idea₁, Idea₂, Idea₃, … }
Dialogue₂ = { Idea₁, Idea₂, Idea₃, … }
Dialogueₙ = { Idea₁, Idea₂, Idea₃, … }

Idea = Atomic meaning-unit (no further subdivision)


## Why this Structure?

- **Clearly distinct and non-overlapping**: Each unit is precisely defined for intuitive clarity.
- **Optimized for computational parsing**: Explicit structure facilitates embedding, indexing, retrieval, and semantic logic.
- **Matches intuitive human conversational patterns**: Easy to understand and implement for both developers and users.

This clearly structured hierarchy serves as the definitive reference for knowledge parsing, abstraction, and management within the AI project.
