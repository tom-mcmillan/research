## Reality Testing

“The concept of “reality-testing” has been the centerpiece of traditional psychological and psychoanalytic understandings of the nature and function of fantasy and the imagination. In the customary view, perceptions of the world around us, including other people, are influenced both by the way things really are and by our imaginative elaborations of the ways things are and our fantasies of how we would like things to be. Imagination and fantasy are potential contaminants, because they threaten to obscure our direct perception of how things really are. They are fine in their own domain, clearly identified as illusions, but the labels need to be kept very clear. Sandcastles are not habitable. 

But recent theorists have begun to challenge the neat separation between our perceptions of how things really are and our fantasy-driven imagination. It may be, it is now believed, that we can only find a satisfying habitable dwelling by first identifying it as a favorite sandcastle. 

Consider this startling definition of reality testing offered by Hans Loewald, the visionary American psychoanalyst: “Reality testing is far more than an intellectual or cognitive function. It may be understood more comprehensively as the experiential testing of fantasy—its potential and suitability for actualization—and the testing of actuality—its potential for encompassing it in, and penetrating it with, one’s fantasy life. We deal with the task of a reciprocal transposition.” Here reality is tested not to eliminate from it unrealistic infantile fantasies, but to probe it for sites in which one can locate and cultivate fantasies. For Loewald, the rational, objective perspective we normally consider “reality” is useful for many activities we require for adaptive living. But as a steady fare, objective reality becomes a devitalized shadow of a fuller experience that is made possible when the actual can be animated and brought alive through fantasy.” ([Mitchell, 2002, p. 86](zotero://select/library/items/82D9EDWS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VZ45LF9V?page=86&annotation=FTMHML7X))


## Case Theory

### Traditional definitions / frameworks / uses

“Case theory - or theory of the case - can be seen as an explanatory statement linking the "case" to the client's experience of the world. It serves as a lens for shaping reality, in light of the law, to explain the facts, relationships, and circumstances of the client and other parties in the way that can best achieve the client's goals.13 The relevant reality combines the perspectives of the lawyer and the client with an eye toward the ultimate audience - the trier of fact.” (Miller, 1994, p. 487)

“Case theory provides a framework for trial preparation and ultimately for trial.37 It has been defined as "the basic underlying idea that explains not only the legal theory and factual background, but also ties as much of the evidence as possible into a coherent and credible whole."38 Case theory is not simply a statement of the applicable law or of the facts that support this legal interpretation, but rather it is the "basic concept around which everything else revolves."3” (Miller, 1994, p. 492)

“The theory of the case should be expressed in simple declarative sentences49 that combine the legal theory with central factual assertions.” (Miller, 1994, p. 493)

“Once a case theory is selected,52 it serves as the centerpiece for all strategic and tactical decisions in the case.53 T” ([Miller, 1994, p. 494](zotero://select/library/items/NL56H4FS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BUHDKE7Q?page=11&annotation=4567GGNI))

### Theory of Client-Centeredness

“client-centered counseling, or client decisionmaking, holds that lawyers should interact with clients in a way that allows clients to make decisions themselves.113 Together, the lawyer and her client consider the various alternatives available in the case and the likely consequences of these alternatives and then weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the alternatives in reaching a decision.114 Although the lawyer is an active participant in the decisionmaking process, she should ensure that her preferences do not override client choices.115” ([Miller, 1994, p. 503](zotero://select/library/items/NL56H4FS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BUHDKE7Q?page=20&annotation=TYSHMQ2F))

“Client decisionmaking is supported by the principle of client autonomy and by the idea that the client is in a better position than the lawyer to evaluate alternatives and consequences. Under this view, the client has the right to make his own choices because it is he who stands to gain or lose the most from decisions made in his case. The client is also more knowledgeable than his lawyer about his individual concerns and how they mesh with the available legal alternatives.” ([Miller, 1994, p. 503-504](zotero://select/library/items/NL56H4FS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BUHDKE7Q?page=21))

“Only the client can measure the tradeoffs between the choices of plea or trial and their respective consequences.12” ([Miller, 1994, p. 504](zotero://select/library/items/NL56H4FS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BUHDKE7Q?page=21&annotation=QWK5PWV4))

“Client-centered theory concedes that some decisions must be reserved for attorneys or the practice of law would become unworkable. Because legal representation requires a large number of decisions, lawyers do not have the time to discuss every decision with a client.125 This approach not only would take too many hours but would prevent an attorney from implementing many decisions because the time frame for some decisions, especially those in litigation, is too short to permit lawyer-client consultation. Thus, clients should concentrate their energy on the task of figuring out what they want to achieve through legal re” ([Miller, 1994, p. 505](zotero://select/library/items/NL56H4FS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BUHDKE7Q?page=22&annotation=IGHDSN8M))

“My aim is to articulate a theory of case theory that is truer both to the client's life experience and to what it is that lawyers actually do. By defining case theory as an explanatory statement linking the case to the client's experience of the world, we create a context for seeing what we might not otherwise see. Case theory creates a perspective for the facts, relationships, and circumstances of the client and other parties that is grounded in the client's goals. Case theory makes actions seem quite reasonable that at first seemed unreasonable, and it allows us to accept the client's story and at the same time have a plausible explanation for other stories” ([Miller, 1994, p. 553](zotero://select/library/items/NL56H4FS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BUHDKE7Q?page=70&annotation=8LGY8L9S))

“listen to patients' stories before offering ready conceptualizations of their problems and to recognize that diagnosis is only a guess - an effort to connect a particular patient to a category of patients.31” ([Miller, 1994, p. 554](zotero://select/library/items/NL56H4FS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BUHDKE7Q?page=71&annotation=D8F47KFH))

“As Ludwig put it: "'The people who come to see us bring us their stories. They hope they tell them well enough so that we understand the truth of their lives. They hope we know how to interpret their stories correctly. We have to remember that what we hear is their story.' ” ([Miller, 1994, p. 554](zotero://select/library/items/NL56H4FS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BUHDKE7Q?page=71&annotation=F6EUTLUP))

### Enhancing Client parcipation and control

“Case theory not only assists the lawyer and the fact finder in understanding what happened, but also helps the lawyer explain to the client what happened for the client's own benefit. Of course, the client knows what happened in the sense that he was present and has told a story about the event. But what the client experienced may differ from how he may come to understand that experience. If the lawyer hears the client tell a story that raises the issue of race, the lawyer can walk with the client through the facts in light of this theory.” ([Miller, 1994, p. 563](zotero://select/library/items/NL56H4FS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BUHDKE7Q?page=80&annotation=928ENXG5))


“In addition to challenging the traditional concept of case theory, this new vision also revolutionizes the allocation of decisionmaking authority between lawyers and clients. Rather than choosing a case theory, as in the traditional model, or applying the "substantial impact" or related standard, as in the client-centered model, lawyers would routinely involve clients in decisions about case theory. The client would act as the locus of decisionmaking, while the lawyer would facilitate the process and implement the client's decision” ([Miller, 1994, p. 564](zotero://select/library/items/NL56H4FS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BUHDKE7Q?page=81&annotation=WNZ7AE9X))

“Client expertise extends not only to developing a more winning case theory but also to assessing whether the theory satisfies other client objectives. Strategy, rather than being any action making it more likely that the client will win, becomes richer and more complex. At the same time, it becomes something clients are capable of weighing - perhaps even more capable than lawyers. Even if lawyers are better than clients at assessing the likelihood that judges and juries will accept a particular argument, they are less expert than clients in knowing whether a case theory portrays the client in the way he wants to be portrayed, advances an argument that matters to him on a personal or political level, or makes room for his voice. ” ([Miller, 1994, p. 564-565](zotero://select/library/items/NL56H4FS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BUHDKE7Q?page=81&annotation=SWQSC7V5))

“Finally, this model also values client choice for its own sake even if it does not lead to "better" results in either of the above senses. Rather than being relegated to the netherworld of "mere" strategy, case theory is the piece of the case that goes most to the heart of who the client is by determining how his story is told. Because the client is inside the story, the client has the right to decide how to tell it.” ([Miller, 1994, p. 565](zotero://select/library/items/NL56H4FS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BUHDKE7Q?page=82&annotation=3R9DDKTZ))

“This vision of case theory also leads to a much different lawyerclient counseling dialogue from the one envisioned by clientcentered theorists. Rather than focusing on the choice of procedural mechanism - trial, negotiation, or plea - as the key decision, the counseling dialogue would focus on case theory. Lawyers and clients would discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different case theories from many vantage points, including standard considerations such as which theory is most likely to prevail and whose testimony is necessary to support each theory.” ([Miller, 1994, p. 565](zotero://select/library/items/NL56H4FS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BUHDKE7Q?page=82&annotation=V6W9DITJ))

“Lawyers and clients might also discuss procedural mechanisms, but not in the conventional sense. While for a lawyer the choice of forum is driven by the goal of achieving the best legal result, each forum may also provide different opportunities for storytelling. A client who cares about how she is portrayed by case theory, or who has some other goal for case theory, would want to know how case theory would play out in a given forum. The answer to what the case is about also informs the choice of a particular legal procedure. For example, if a client seeks vindication, then a trial is typically a better alternative than a plea.” ([Miller, 1994, p. 566](zotero://select/library/items/NL56H4FS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BUHDKE7Q?page=83&annotation=VIDH3BNN))


“Case theory discussions are likely to reveal new factual dimensions because clients tell lawyers what they think is important367 and case theory reveals which facts matter.” ([Miller, 1994, p. 566](zotero://select/library/items/NL56H4FS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BUHDKE7Q?page=83&annotation=KDD9IZY5))

“In this dialogue, the client is truly a teacher and a contributor, not simply a recipient of the lawyer's noblesse oblige, as in the prototypical client-centered discussion about nonlegal consequences. The client engages deeply in the process of developing case theory because of what he knows and what the lawyer does not. The client might educate us in ways we cannot even imagine. Once we cede control over case theory to our clients, we must remember that as lawyers we may not be in the best position to understand their choices. We want desperately to ascribe a "why" to their words, yet our understanding is limited by our own frame of reference. We perceive legal strategy as the reason for their actions and only reluctantly consider other possible strategic goals. We forget that the legal consequences of their actions may be entirely accidental. They may have intended something entirely different.” ([Miller, 1994, p. 567](zotero://select/library/items/NL56H4FS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BUHDKE7Q?page=84&annotation=MP44WADG))
