## Inventing of Principle, Jan 20, 2012

### Guiding principle

- live according to a guiding principle
- something you believe is important and necessary and right and using that to guide what you do

### Bret's principle

**Creators need an immediate connection to what they're creating**

1. Ideas are very important

2. bringing ideas into the world is one of the most important things that people do

3. Great ideas, in the form of great art, stories, inventions, and scientific theories, take on lives of their own, which give meaning to our lives as people.

4. I think a lot about how people create ideas and how ideas grow, and in particular what sorts of tools create a healthy environment for ideas to grow. 


What that means:
- when you're making something, if you make a change or you make a decision, you need to see the effect of that immediately.

- there can't be a delay and there can't be anything hidden

- creators have to be able to see what they're doing. 

- his method: show cases where that principle is violated, and show you what I did about that. 

### Golden rules of information design
1. Show the data
2. show conparisons
3. Nothing hidden
4. Nothing to simulate in your head

- Symbols exist becase they are simple to draw on paper. But this is not paper.

### New Mediums

1. How can this new medium allow us more immediate connection to what we're making?

2. How can this new medium allow us to work in such a way that we can see what we're doing?

Make in two minutes, performing with my hands like a musical instrument, very immediate connection between me and what I was trying to make. 


>"I always think about the millions of pieces that are locked in millions of heads. Not just in animation or art, but all kinds of ideas, including critically important ideas, world-changing inventions, life-saving scientific discoveries. These are all ideas that must be grown and without an environment in which they can grow where their creator can nurture them with this immediate connection, many of these ideas will not emerge, or emerge stunted. So I have this principle that creators need an mmediate connection. And all the demos i just showd you simply came from me looking around and noticing places where that principle was violated and then trying to fix that. That's really all i did. I just folled this guiding principle, and it guided me to what I had to do."

### Motivation

When I see a violation of this principle, I don't think of that as an opportunity. Ideas are very prescious to me, and when I see ideas dying it hurts. I see a tradegy. To me it feels like a moral wrong. It feels like an injustice. And if I think there's anything I can do about it, I feel it's my responsibility to do so. Not opportunity, but responsibility. 

**Activist lifestyle** = a person dedicates themselves to fighting for a cause that they believe in. 

activist lifestyle for technologists. fight by inventing. 

**Principles** are a Reaction to a cultural context, having cultural intent

1. recognized a wrong that had been unrecognized in the culture. 
2. envisioned a world without that wrong
3. dedicated themselves to fighting for a principle. 

### Examples

**Larry Tessler:** No person should be trapped in a mode. No modes!

- Belief in the opportunity of personal computing. The complexity of modes was a barrier to what personal computing could be.

- Create a modeless text editor -- drag and drop, cut copy paste, highlight, insert text (gypsy). Somebody who had never used a computer before couldbe up and running inaa half hour. 

- Enabling people to connect with computers. 

**Doug Engelbart** To enable mankind to solve the world's urgent problems. 

**Alan Kay** Amplify human reach and bring new ways of thinking to a faltering civilization that desperately needed it.

**Richard Stallman** Software must be free, as in freedom.

### Questions
1. what matters to me?
2. what i believe in
3. what i might fight for

## The Future of Programming, July 9, 2013

### Theme
People are often slow to move from one technology / representation to a better one, but that we should keep striving for better abstractions.

### Four points

**1. coding -> direct manipulation of data**

We should move from symbolic coding to the direct manipulation of data

This seems reasonable, yet of course as Bret would agree, symbolic reasoning is powerful too.

**2. procedures -> goals and constraints**

we should move from lower level to higher level instructions to the computer

Nothing that inflamatory here, yet its implecations are far-reaching. For example, variables are way too low-level. Listing instructions – sequential programming – also seems too low level, which he touches in his 4th point.

So much of what makes programming difficult for beginners, as team behind Eve figured out, is scope. This is not a low-level concern, but a interface design concern.

**3. text dump -> spatial representation**

Sequential text should move towards richer visual displays.

Pretty straight-forward in principle, yet we haven’t figure this out in practice – potentially because we haven’t found the right “glue” to piece non-textual programs together. Copy and paste and Unix pipes are powerful.

**4. Sequential -> concurrent**

Sequential instructions should move towards a concurrent model.

Funny how so many of these goals point towards functional programming, yet how few of Bret’s demos look like functional programming.

I guess the Lambda Alligator do but I never got those…
