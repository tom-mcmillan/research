# Core Functionalities and Their Mapping for Conductor

## 1. Unified Orchestration of User Requests

### Purpose:
    - Receive user input in natural language.
    - Route the request to the appropriate internal service.
    - Aggregate and synthesize responses from multiple specialized components.

### Implementation:
    - File: orchestration/conductor.go
    - Role: Acts as the central orchestrator that manages the conversation thread and delegates tasks.

## 2. Logical Reasoning and Validation

### Purpose:
    - Analyze user inputs for logical consistency, mathematical accuracy, or decision-making.
    - Categorize and process complex queries.

### Implementation:
    - File: reasoning/assistant.go
    - Role: Processes and validates user inputs using domain-specific logic.

## 3. Command Translation & Execution

### Purpose:
    - Convert natural language instructions into executable bash commands.
    - Safely execute these commands on the user’s local machine.

### Implementation:
    - Files:
        - tasks/bash.go – Executes validated bash commands locally.
        - tasks/runner.go – (Programs Assistant) Translates user ideas into precise, executable commands (optionally leveraging resources like Claude for Code).
    - Flow Example:
        - User says: “Make a folder called ‘Reports’ on my Desktop.”
        - The Programs Assistant generates a command such as: mkdir ~/Desktop/Reports
        - This command is executed locally to create the folder.

## 4. Data Persistence and Session Management

### Purpose:
    - Store and retrieve session data, conversation history, and generated artifacts.
    - Maintain context between user interactions.

### Implementation:
    - Files:
        - repository/filestore.go – Handles local file storage for logs or artifacts.
        - repository/session.go – Manages session data storage and retrieval.
        - repository/storage.go – (Optional) Uses AI-assisted methods for structured storage (e.g., embeddings).

## 5. External Network Integration

### Purpose:
    - Interface with external APIs and cloud services (e.g., OpenAI, Google Workspace) to send and receive data.
    - Support functionalities such as email retrieval, cloud computations, etc.

### Implementation:
    - Files:
        - external/openai/client.go – Manages connections to the OpenAI API.
        - external/google/client.go – Manages integration with Google Workspace.
        - Networking Assistants provide specialized network-related functions.

## 6. User-Facing Presentation

### Purpose:
    - Format and deliver responses to the user in a clear, engaging manner.
    - Bridge backend responses to the frontend display (desktop or web UI).

### Implementation:
    - File: api/handlers.go – Handles HTTP API endpoints and presentation logic.
    - Frontend components render outputs based on these structured responses.

## 7. Configuration and Utility Support

### Purpose:
    - Manage environment settings, API keys, and configuration data.
    - Provide shared helper functions and utilities that support all layers of the app.

### Implementation:
    - File: config/config.go (or utilities/config.go) – Central configuration management.

## Overall, Conductor is designed to:
    - Orchestrate multiple specialized services (reasoning, command execution, storage, networking, and presentation) into a unified interaction.
    - Empower users to convert natural language into actionable tasks, accessing both local and cloud-based computing resources.
    - Maintain clarity through a modular, well-organized codebase that maps each core functionality to a dedicated layer.

## Additional Considerations:
    - Files uploaded by users are handled by OpenAI’s thread mechanism, with user-level and team-level vector DBs managed externally.
    - Each user authenticates via Google OAuth, and teams are configured to share a vector DB.
    - All epiphanies and architectural decisions are recorded here in vision.txt for future reference and as potential knowledge for AI assistants.
