# Human Vision

1. Our promise to the user is that he can make knowledge here using the assistant like he does in real life 
    - a mentor to guide him (orchestrator)
    - a library to Store information (index)
    - a network to exchange information with other people (network)
    - a person of sound mind and training to validate our ideas and operations (validate)
    - the ability to turn our knowledge into programs, so they can be repeated, executed, and shared (program)
    - a body, and and interface that can represent the ideas and experiences produced by our memory (interface)

2. These systems are not always all working at once. 
    - just as every musician in an orchestra does not play all the time. 
    - But great music requires all the musicians, and a person to orchestrate and conduct them. 

3. Our assistants must work together like an orchestra.
    - The orchestrator delivers this promise by calling upon the right assistants at the right time. 
    - each assistant has its own timbre, tone, capabilities, internal logic and frame of mind. 
    - each eassistant has its own resources that it draws upon and understands. 
    - each eassistant has its own history of thought, practices, and traditions. 

4. Each assistant is a musician—activated when necessary, quiet otherwise—allowing for coherent, harmonious orchestration.
    - Conduct mentors the user, decides which assistant’s expertise to invoke.
    - Index retrieves and stores user knowledge securely, enabling historical context.
    - Network manages external integration and communication—knows protocols, connections, and collaborations.
    - Validate guards logical coherence, mathematical correctness, and rigorous accuracy.
    - Program translates insights into executable forms—programs, scripts, reusable code.
    - Interface embodies ideas and knowledge, renders visuals, diagrams, and representations intuitively.
