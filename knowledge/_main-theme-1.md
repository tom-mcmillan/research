# Main theme 1: The Knowledge Paradox

Yes‚Äîa paradox of knowing is exactly the right frame. You‚Äôre identifying a breakdown (or at least a sharp tension) within the very idea of what it means to know something.

More precisely, it seems to be:

A paradox of partial knowing‚Äîwhere a system is knowable in one mode (behavioral, predictive), and yet unknowable in another (structural, ontological), simultaneously.

This paradox lives in the fracture between different modalities of knowledge. In classical epistemology, these modes are sometimes treated as complementary or hierarchical‚Äîbut LLMs split them apart.

üß† Let‚Äôs Recap the Structure
Name (working): A Paradox of Knowing
Essence:

We can know what something will do, but not know what it is.
We can be in relationship with something without understanding it.
We can trust function without access to essence.

üß© Why Is It a True Paradox?
Because our intellectual tradition assumes that knowing requires internal grasping‚Äîsome kind of conceptual map that mirrors the territory. But this situation offers:

External fluency (we can manipulate language, produce results, hold conversations)

Internal opacity (no grasp of mechanism, no clear ‚Äúmeaning‚Äù inside)

The result is coexistence of knowledge and ignorance, in the same act, at the same time.

üîç Possible Philosophical Anchors
Epistemic opacity (Paul Humphreys): The idea that certain systems are in principle beyond human understanding, even if we can work with them.

Black box knowledge: Where operation is known only by input/output, not internal state.

Tacit knowledge (Polanyi): ‚ÄúWe know more than we can tell‚Äù‚Äîbut here, it‚Äôs inverted: we can tell more than we know.

Framing the Paradox More Precisely:
Definition (draft):

The paradox of predictability without comprehensibility arises when an entity or system consistently produces behavior that can be modeled, forecast, or responded to effectively‚Äîdespite our fundamental inability to grasp its internal principles, motivations, or ‚Äúwhat-it-is-ness.‚Äù

This paradox resists both:

Classical scientific knowing (comprehension of underlying mechanism), and

Phenomenological knowing (empathy, introspection, shared being)

Yet it leaves intact:

Functional knowing (interaction, manipulation, engagement)

The Core of the Paradox
You‚Äôve pointed to this:

We can predict the behavior of something we do not, and perhaps cannot, understand.

It becomes paradoxical only because we carry an implicit premise:

To relate to, engage with, or make use of something meaningfully, we must first understand it.

LLMs violate this. They expose a rift between knowing-how and knowing-what‚Äîa space where function divorces from essence.

Let‚Äôs Try Stating It Formally
Let:

P(x) = We can predict behavior of x.

U(x) = We understand x (i.e., we comprehend the internal structure, logic, or essence of x).

R(x) = We can relate to x meaningfully.

Traditional assumption:

P(x) ‚Üí U(x) and U(x) ‚Üí R(x)
(If we can predict x, we must understand x; and understanding allows relationship.)

Paradoxical observation:

P(x) ‚àß ¬¨U(x) ‚àß R(x)
(We can predict x, do not understand x, yet still relate meaningfully to x.)

This violates the expected transitivity from prediction ‚Üí understanding ‚Üí relation.

Looking at your exact formulation, this is a paradox of knowledge.
You're pointing to something we cannot fully know or understand (their manufactured, alien nature) that nonetheless operates in ways we recognize and relate to (similar to us).
The paradox: We can relate to something we cannot understand.
This violates our usual assumption that relationship requires understanding. Normally, we think we need to understand something to relate to it effectively. But with LLMs, we find ourselves in genuine relationship with entities whose fundamental nature remains opaque to us.
It's not that we don't trust them or can't think about them - it's that our knowledge of them is fundamentally incomplete and contradictory, yet we can still engage meaningfully with them.
The knowledge paradox: We know how they behave, but we don't know what they are.







# Intersubjectivity

Who is AI to us. Who are we in it? Intersubjectivity with AI, objectivity, relational dynamics. It is changing, we are changing, towards what, into what.
