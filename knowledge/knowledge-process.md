# Knowledge Process

## 1. Initial Socratic Exchange:
    
    - User impressions and questions are discussed interactively, leading to "unstructured knowledge." This stage is termed a "knowledge session."​

## 2. Creation of Knowledge Artifacts:
    
    - The unstructured knowledge is then parsed into precise, minimally processed units called Knowledge Artifacts.
    
    - Each Knowledge Artifact:
        - Captures critical insights, strategies, ideas, or concerns directly.
        - Is represented in JSON format.
        - Includes metadata (such as creation time and location).
        - Has a unique identifier or "knowledge_id" (e.g., know_ followed by a 20-digit alphanumeric code).​

## 3. Embedding and Storage:
    
    - The produced Knowledge Artifacts are embedded into a vector database, where they can be retrieved, processed, exchanged, or used in future tasks.​

## 4. Utilization and Transformation:
    
    - These stored artifacts are treated as the new raw materials or building blocks for the user. They can be combined and rendered into various outputs such as:
        - Programs
        - Texts
        - Experiences
        - Products
        - Interfaces
        - Networks
        - Memory​

## 5. End Result:
    
    - The creation, storage, retrieval, and rendering of these artifacts into useful outputs ultimately leads to the user's satisfaction and happiness. This final satisfaction is central to the knowledge production objective.​
